# IMAGE-STEGANOGRAPHY
ENCODING AND DECODING HIDDEN DATA WITHIN AN IMAGE FILE
Project Prerequisites:
To build this Python Image Steganography project, we will need the following libraries:
1. *Tkinter* – To create the GUI
2. *PIL* – Python Image Manipulation library. It is used to perform operations on images in python.
While the Tkinter library comes pre-installed with Python, the PIL library does not, so you will have to run the following command to install it.
>> python -m pip install pillow
